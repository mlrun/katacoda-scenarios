[MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) requires an accessible docker-registry (such as Docker Hub).
The registryâ€™s URL and credentials are provided to the applications via a Kubernetes secret.

In this tutorial, you will use a local Docker registry.

>**NOTE**: The unauthenticated local registry is used here for demo purposes only. In production environments, 
> you should use an appropriate docker registry, with proper authentication and persistency.

- Install a docker registry:

`docker run --detach --publish 30100:5000 registry:2`{{execute}}

- Export the registry URL as an environment variable:

`export REGISTRY=[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30100-[[KATACODA_HOST]].[[KATACODA_DOMAIN]]`{{execute}}

- Once the registry is up and running, you would be able to inspect its contents using its HTTP API:

`curl $REGISTRY/v2/_catalog`{{execute}}

> **NOTE**: The above command will show an empty catalog, as our "fresh" registry contains no images yet
