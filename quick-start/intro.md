[MLRun](https://www.iguazio.com/open-source/mlrun/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) MLOps framework
 that offers an integrative approach to managing your machine-learning pipelines; from early development, through model development, and to full pipeline deployment in production.

MLRun offers a convenient abstraction layer to a wide variety of technology stacks while empowering data engineers
 and data scientists to define the features and models with ease and flexibility.

MLRun serving can take MLRun models or standard model files and produce managed, real-time, serverless functions
based on the [Nuclio real-time serverless framework](https://www.iguazio.com/open-source/nuclio/).
Nuclio is focused on performance and flexibility, and is built around data, I/O, and compute intensive workloads.

In the following course you will learn how to:

- Set up an MLRun stack on a Kubernetes Cluster
- Train, test, and serve a Model

More information about MLRun and its architecture can be found [here](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest).
